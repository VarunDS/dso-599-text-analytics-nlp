    "A. Build a **deep learning neural network** to predict any classification label in your dataset. Your implementation must include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* use of word embeddings (GloVe, fasttext, word2vec)\n",
    "\n",

    "* discussion of baseline accuracy and most important performance metrics to consider when evaluating your model\n",

    "B. Build **an unsupervised clustering model** to cluster and visualize the text in your dataset. Your implementation must include:\n",
    "- a **dimensionality reduction** technique (SVD, t-SNE, PCA)\n",
    "- a **clustering algorithm** (k-NN, k-means, Gaussian mixture models, etc.)\n",
    "- a discussion of which vectorization technique performs the best and why (GloVe, TF-IDF, word count, one-hot encoding, word2vec)\n",
    "\n",
    "C. Use the `complete-shakespeare.txt` dataset for this task. Write a **regular expression that provides**:\n",
    "- all stage instructions (non-dialogue)\n",
    "- everything spoken by the character `CALIBAN`\n",
    "- all sentences that end in exclamation points\n",
    "- a dictionary with the key being the scene name, and the value being a list of all the characters who appear in them."
