    "2. Find the **most similar sentences or documents in your dataset using word count, TF-IDF, and word-embeddings** as your vectorization techniques. If the computation is slow, **you may subsample** for only a few thousand rows. (2 pts)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualize the reduced dimension individual documents on a scatter plot**. Comment on which vectorization technique appears to yield the best results and why- compare and contrast the effectiveness of each of your dimensionality reduction techniques on visualizing the data. (2 pts)\n",
