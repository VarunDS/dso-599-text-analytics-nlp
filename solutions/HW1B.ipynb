    "#### To answer marketing manager's questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first assumption is that the customer segment (sons, significant others, grandchildren, siblings, self, etc.) appeared in the reviews indicates who the toy was bought for.\n",
    "\n",
    "* From the result of unique word count, we can see that \"daughter and daughters\" together occurred 6381 times, \"son and sons\" together occurred 6224 times, \"grandson and grandsons\" together occurred 3485 times in positive reviews. So, for positive reviews, the top 3 most frequently appeared customer segments are daughter, son, and grandson.\n",
    "\n",
    "     For negative reviews, \"son and sons\" together occurred 559 times, \"daughter and daughters\" together occurred 371 times,  \"grandson and grandsons\" together occurred 145 times. So, for negative reviews, the top 3 most frequently appeared customer segments are son, daughter and grandson.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can also see the bar graphs in the python code below to have a more detailed customer segments information and how many times they appeared in reviews (Bar graphs are in the \"Word Count for Positive Reviews\" and \"Word Count for Negative Reviews\" sections).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* To analyze which customer segments' marketing messaging tends to outperform other segments, I considered the following factors:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Customer segment word count in positive reviews, which shows how many likes from each customer segment\n",
    "    2. Customer segment word count in negative reviews, which shows how many dislikes from each customer segment\n",
    "    3. Review star (5 star for positive and 1 star for negative), which indicates level of satisfaction for each customer segment\n",
    "\n",
    "    We could not just consider the word count in positive or negative reviews individually, because the cutomer segment that has the most positive reviews may also has the most negative reviews. In this case, we cannot say this customer segment outperforms or falls behind the others. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    However, if we assumed that for each customer segment, the number of word counts is equal to the number of reviews and can somewhat represent the quantity of sales, then we can use the sum of word counts in both positive and negative reviews to evaluate sales for each customer segment. The larger the sum, the more toys were sold to the corresponding customer segment. Result for this approach is shown below:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "     {'daughter': 6752,\n",
    " 'granddaughter': 2488,\n",
    " 'grandson': 3630,\n",
    " 'nephew': 1171,\n",
    " 'niece': 1030,\n",
    " 'self': 127,\n",
    " 'sibling': 886,\n",
    " 'son': 6783}\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    From the result, we can see that sales for \"son\" and \"daughter\" are far above the others. Therefore, according to this \"sales\" approach, I would conclude that son and daughter are the customer segments whose marketing messaging tend to outperform other segments. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    What if the sales are high but reviews are poor? To solve this problem, we need to consider customer's level of satisfaction. To be specific, I want to see the average review star for each customer segment. Based on that, I made the following assumption: for each customer segment, the number of word counts is equal to the number of reviews.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Then, I calculated the average review star for each customer segment. For example, \"son\" counts 6224 in positive reviews and 559 in negative reviews. Given 5 star for a positive review and 1 star for a negative review, the average review star for son is (5 x 6224 + 1 x 559) / (6224 + 559) = 4.67\n",
    "    \n",
    "    According to the average review star calculation method above, the result for each customer segment is shown below:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    {'daughter': 4.78,\n",
    " 'granddaughter': 4.887,\n",
    " 'grandson': 4.84,\n",
    " 'nephew': 4.891,\n",
    " 'niece': 4.864,\n",
    " 'self': 4.37,\n",
    " 'sibling': 4.828,\n",
    " 'son': 4.67}\n",
    " ```\n",
    "    From the result of average review star, we can see that nephew has the highest average review star, granddaughter ranks the second. Therefore, according to this evaluation approach, I would conclude that nephew and granddaughter are the customer segments whose marketing messaging tend to outperform other segments. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    However, the average star approach cares more about level of satisfaction than about quantity of sales. Therefore, there is a trade-off between sales and level of satisfaction in this case. Which customer segment performs better depends on the goal of marketing. If the goal is to sell more, then the \"sales\" approach applies. If the goal is to have better reputation, then the \"average star\" approach applies. If the goal is both of them, then I would recommend to combine the marketing strategy for son and daughter (large sales volume) with the marketing strategy for nephew and granddaughter (better reputation)."

    "#### To answer product manager's question:\n",
    "   * I would reject the hypothesis. To explain why, I need to make the following assumptions firstly:\n",
    "       1. Count of \"battery\" and \"batteries\" equals the number of reviews that mention \"battery\" and \"batteries\" (keywords appear only once per review);\n",
    "       2. Reviews that mention \"battery\" or \"batteries\" are belong to toys with battery;\n",
    "       3. For the rest reviews that do not mention \"battery\" or \"batteries\", there is a certain percentage of reviews (\"battery_per\") belong to toys with battery. The percentage is the same for both positive and negative reviews;\n",
    "       4. If the average review for toys with battery is lower than 95% of the average review for toys without battery, then they have significant difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Based on the above assumptions, I tried different percentages (\"battery_per\") and interestingly found out that the average reviews for toys without battery were constant, which is 4.57. The average reviews for toys with battery kept increasing as percentage increased but they never exceeded 4.57.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    To make it more straightforward, I plot the average reviews for toys with and without battery based on different percentages (\"battery_per\"), which is in the code below (\"Battery\" section). I also plot out the threshold line (the green dashed line), where the part below means that toys with batteries tend to be significantly lower rated than toys that do not require batteries, while the part above does not indicate the statement above. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    As a result, we can see that if the threshold is 4.57 * 95% = 4.34, the percentage (\"battery_per\") is about 3%, meaning that if the hypothesis is true, then for the reviews that do not mention battery, there should be no more than 3% of them belong to toys with battery and no less than 97% belong to toys without battery. This could be possible but seems not to be realistic. I believe there is a larger probability that for the reviews that do not mention battery, there are more than 3% of them belong to toys with battery and less than 97% belong to toys without battery. If it is the case, then the toys with batteries do not tend to be significantly lower rated than toys that do not require batteries. Therefore, I would reject the hypothesis."
